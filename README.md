# House Rent Prediction Project

## Description

This project aims to predict house rents using three different machine learning models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The process involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization, followed by model training and evaluation. The models' performance is assessed using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics, and the results are visualized using Matplotlib for clear insights.

### Features
